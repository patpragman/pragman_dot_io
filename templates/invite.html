        <p class="lead">To Pat's post-graduation beer-stravaganza.  The summer is here, we made it!  Let's have a barbecue, have some fun, and just generally enjoy our lives!  Bring beer, food, and let's have some fun in the sun (if it's sunny).  This is a family friendly event, it's close enough so that we can celebrate my daugther's birthday as well!</p>
