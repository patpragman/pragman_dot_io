        At Pragman Family Farms, we’re proud of our roots in sustainable agriculture—but we’re also passionate about all things STEM. We’re not only a farm—we also offer custom software, custom machine learning solutions that apply to your business problems, web apps (like this one), and hands-on guidance on how to leverage new AI tools. The goal of our business is blending technology with a DIY solarpunk spirit in Alaska. We're "makers" here—and if you've got a problem, we'd like to take a shot at solving it.
