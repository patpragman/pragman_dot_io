      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p class="body_text">
        At Pragman Family Farms, we envision a future where communities not only survive but thrive, rooted in the principles of radical self-sufficiency and inspired by the bold creativity of solar-punk ideals. We believe that everyone deserves access to fresh, nutritious food, no matter where they live—whether in the heart of Alaska or the most remote corners of the globe. Our mission is to empower individuals and communities to achieve food independence by leveraging advanced technology, sustainable practices, and a relentless spirit of innovation.
        <br><br>
        This vision fuels our determination to make high-tech agriculture approachable and affordable for all. From our garage in Alaska, we are proving that even the harshest environments are no match for ingenuity and a commitment to progress. We see every challenge as an opportunity to refine our methods, and every harvest as a testament to the incredible potential of human creativity and collaboration. At Pragman Family Farms, we’re not just growing food—we’re cultivating a movement toward resilience, abundance, and hope.

      <h2>Technology & Innovation</h2>
      <p class="body_text">
        Innovation is the cornerstone of Pragman Family Farms, and our technology represents a marriage of creativity, accessibility, and purpose. Using Bambu Lab X1C 3D printers, we modify open-source hardware, designing and prototyping advanced hydroponic systems tailored to the unique challenges of Alaskan agriculture. Our commitment to open-source principles allows us to draw inspiration from the global maker community while contributing back with our own innovations.
        <br><br>
        In particular, we’re starting with an amazing open-source tower design from <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/214665#profileId-509086" target="_blank">this model</a>, released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons BY</a> license, and are modifying it to thrive in Alaska’s extreme conditions. Each custom grow basket, modular farm component, and sustainable energy solution we develop brings us closer to a world where anyone can produce food, no matter their circumstances.
        <br><br>
        Our systems are designed not just for functionality but for scalability and adaptability. Whether it’s a single tower for a family home or an integrated solution for an entire community, our hydroponic setups prioritize minimal waste, energy efficiency, and reliability. Through an iterative design approach, we continuously refine every aspect of our hydroponic towers for maximum efficiency, durability, and user-friendliness. By pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in challenging environments, we believe we can transform the way the world grows food and ensure that technology remains a force for good.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p class="body_text">
        Pragman Family Farms is more than a business—it’s a calling to reimagine what is possible. Our journey began in a small Alaskan garage, sparked by a passion for problem-solving and a desire to address food insecurity in our local community. We are a team of dreamers, innovators, and doers, united by a belief that technology can empower even the most remote communities to take control of their food production.
        <br><br>
        Our work is driven by curiosity and optimism. Every prototype is a bold experiment, every system a step toward self-sufficiency, and every harvest a triumph of determination over adversity. We approach challenges with a mindset of possibility, knowing that each solution we develop today has the potential to shape a better tomorrow. At Pragman Family Farms, we aren’t just creating tools for growing food—we’re laying the foundation for a more sustainable, equitable, and hopeful future for all.
